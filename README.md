# ConduitFly

###

This is my first Minecraft plugin project!
It adds a simple system where players can fly near conduit blocks on Skyblock islands.
Flight distance and duration can be customized based on player permissions.


The project is still in early development, and I'm learning and improving as I go.
Any feedback or suggestions are very welcome!
